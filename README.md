# Natro-Alt-Synchronization
A extension to Natro Macro that adds the ability to synchronize an alt account with a main account to gather in the same field.

This is particularly useful for tad alts in blue hives, as it allows players to use boosts (gained from the blue field booster) in fields that they normally would not gather in.
DM @aqts on Discord (or message @Vqrtical on Roblox) for assistance, and please give this repository a star if it helped you!

SETUP:
1. You will need a Discord bot setup on both your alt and main account. See https://discord.com/channels/1012610056921038868/1088923608295936000 (in Natro Macro discord) to help you do so.
2. After installing, in the "Misc" tab of the macro, you will find the "Field Following" setting. Enable it for both accounts, and set the main account to "Leader" and alt to "Follower".
3. Set a max time that the alt will follow the main account to a different field (in seconds), this should typically be 900 seconds (15 minutes). You can ignore this number for the main account.
4. Create a new Discord channel (that the discord bots have permissions to!) and copy the ID of it. Paste it in the "Channel ID" option in both your alt and main account.
5. Done! These settings are NOT controllable with remote control or when the macro is paused, so make sure to stop the macro to do so.
