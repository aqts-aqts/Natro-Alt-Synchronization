# Natro-Alt-Synchronization
A extension to Natro Macro that adds the ability to synchronize an alt account with a main account to gather in the same field.

This is particularly useful for tad alts in blue hives, as it allows players to use boosts (gained from the blue field booster) in fields that they normally would not gather in.
